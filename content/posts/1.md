# Oh god, I'm talking about a... {{<red>}}FRAMEWORK!!{{</red>}}
*{{<subtext>}}this is gonna make someone mad...{{</subtext>}}*


### Okay... I like Svelte
And I don't like {{<red>}}React{{</red>}} (mainly because of performance and it gets weird). lemme explain, the concept of being able to do all your logic, visuals, and styling in a single file, while keeping it separate from others is AWESOME! Which is one of the main reasons why I, and many others, enjoy Svelte. Also our {{<red>}}framework{{</red>}} isn't being 
shoved down our throats by a *{{<subtext>}}lizard{{</subtext>}}* CEO of a gagillionbillion dollar tech company which also likes to spy on you *{{<subtext>}}allegedly{{</subtext>}}*.

But then you think, why did I write this site with Hugo? Why not Svelte since I like it so much? Cause I wanted to, it is easier to write Markdown instead of HTML/CSS/JS.

And that's why I like Svelte! Ok show's over you can leave 👋.
