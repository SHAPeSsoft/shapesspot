# About

This site was proudly built with <a href="https://gohugo.io/" target="_blank">**Hugo**</a>, because I didn't want to write an entire site. The theme is a "fork"(?) of <a href="https://themes.gohugo.io/themes/hugo-theme-terminal/" target="_blank">Terminal</a> by <a href="https://github.com/panr" target="_blank">panr</a> on Github. If you wanna send me a email it's **noah.g.270stx@gmail.com** I recommend the subject field of the email to have [ShapesSpot] or something similar in it, I'll pay more attention to it. Yeah, I think that's all for an About page.
