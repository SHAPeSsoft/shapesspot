### Who is SHAPeS?
Now here's a little about me, I'm SHAPeS (or Noah, whichever) I like writing colors on a metal box and watch it do stuff, or for smart people, **I write code**.
### Why the name SHAPeS?
Honestly, I **have no clue**, the name popped into my head one day, I just didn't like plain "shapes" so I went with **SHAPeS**. It's kinda like Valve's logo, it's stylized "VALVe". And I really like Valve
### What are you know for?
Well, nothing... **yet!** If I make something people like I'll put it here. For now *emptiness* {{<subtext>}}Maybe send me some ideas?{{</subtext>}}
### If (for some reason) I want to support you, where would I do that?
Idk... I have a Ethereum crypto wallet that i made when i was bored:
**[0x792a8DF5105c11B09E755BAEbD4D8272F6573D85](https://etherscan.io/address/0x792a8DF5105c11B09E755BAEbD4D8272F6573D85)**
{{<subtext>}}Link to etherscan.io, or just copy{{</subtext>}}
