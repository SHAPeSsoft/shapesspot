# If you find any bugs/typos
Head on over to [my Github issues](https://github.com/shapessoft/shapesspot) and send an issue or pr! But don't be a douche about it and send
```markdown
    <!---
        {{<rainbow>}}plz accept i want shirt, superprograms431{{</rainbow>}}
    --->
```
Because I **WILL** ignore them!
Also if you want you can use the [source code](https://github.com/shapessoft/shapesspot) of this site to fork and make your own! {{<subtext>}}It's kinda useless, its just a pre-made style and my blabbing.{{</subtext>}}
