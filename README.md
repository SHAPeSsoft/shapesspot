This is my personal blog page, it exists purely for you to criticize. I think...

If you want it on your machine click the big green code button and download as zip, or run

```bash
    git clone git@github.com:SHAPeSsoft/shapesspot.git
```
or if you don't have a SSH key
```bash
    git clone https://github.com/SHAPeSsoft/shapesspot.git
```
